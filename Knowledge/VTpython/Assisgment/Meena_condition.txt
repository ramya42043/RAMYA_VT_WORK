1.What is Ternary operator?Does python have a Ternary operator?

The ternary operator is an operator that takes three arguments. The first argument is a comparison argument, the second is the result upon a true comparison, and the third is the result upon a false comparison. If it helps you can think of the operator as shortened way of writing an if-else statement.

a if condition else b

First condition is evaluated, then either a or b is returned based on the Boolean value of condition
If condition evaluates to True a is returned, else b is returned.



2.What is a conditional statement in Python?

 The condition may be any expression, and true is any non-zero value. The loop iterates while the condition is true.

When the condition becomes false, program control passes to the line immediately following the loop.

	while expression:
  		 statement(s)
	
	if expression1:
	   statement(s)

	elif expression2:
	   statement(s)

	elif expression3:
	   statement(s)

	else:
	   statement(s
	


3.Write a Python program to construct the following pattern, using a nested for loop.

*

	#!/usr/bin/python

	for num1 in range(6):
		for num2 in range(num1):
		        print "* ",
		print"\n"

	num3=num1-1
	while(num3>0):
		for num4 in range(num3):
		        print "* ",
		print "\n"
		num3=num3-1



4.Write a Python program to convert month name to a number of days.
Expected Output: 
List of months: January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August
, September, October, November, December                                
Input the name of Month: February                                       
No. of days: 28/29 days 

	#!/usr/bin/python

	print("List of months: January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November, December")

	month_name = raw_input("Input the name of Month: ")

	print month_name

	if month_name == "February":
		print("No. of days: 28/29 days")
	elif month_name in ("April", "June", "September", "November"):
		print("No. of days: 30 days")
	elif month_name in ("January", "March", "May", "July", "August", "October", "December"):
		print("No. of days: 31 day")
	else:
		print("Wrong month name")
	                                       



5.write a python program that prints all the numbers from 0 to 6 except 3 and 6
note:use ‘continue’ statemnet
excepted output: 0 1 2 4 5

#!/usr/bin/python

def print0to6skip3and6():

        for number in range(0,7):
                if 3 == number or 6 == number:
                        continue
                else:
                        print number


print0to6skip3and6()
~                                                                               
~                                                                               
~                              



6.Given an array of ints length 3, return an array with the elements "rotated left" so {1, 2, 3} yields {2, 3, 1}.

rotate_left3([1, 2, 3]) → [2, 3, 1]
rotate_left3([5, 11, 9]) → [11, 9, 5]
rotate_left3([7, 0, 0]) → [0, 0, 7]

def rotate_left3(arr):
	
	newarr=arr[1:]+arr[:1]
	return newarr

lis=input("enter integers in the list format\n")
print rotate_left3(lis)


7.Count the number of "xx" in the given string. We'll say that overlapping is allowed, so "xxx" contains 2 "xx".

countXX("abcxx") → 1
countXX("xxx") → 2
countXX("xxxx") → 3

Answer :


	#!/usr/bin/pyhton


	def countXX(word):
		length=len(word)
		count = 0
		for index in range(length-1):
		        if (word[index]=='x') and (word[index+1]=='x'):
		                count +=1
		return count


	string= raw_input("enter the string to count XX overlapped\n")
	result = countXX(string)
	print result
