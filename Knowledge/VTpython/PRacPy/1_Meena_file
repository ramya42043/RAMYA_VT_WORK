//﻿1.Write a program to Copy text from one file to another file?

	fr = open("read.txt", 'r')
	file_data = fp.readlines()
	fw = open("write.txt", 'w')
	for line in file_data:
		fw.write(line)

//2.Accept the file from the user and count the number of words present in the file?
	file = argv[1:2]
	fp = open(file, 'r')
	read_data = fp.read()
	count = read_data.count("str_pattern")
	print "string count in file= ",count
 
//3.How can you open a file in python? What are diferent types of file modes?
	fp = open("file_name", 'mode')
	modes:
	r = read file
	w = write file
	a = append at end
	r+ = read and write
	w+ = read and write
	a+ = read and append
	wb = read binary file
	rb = write binary file
	
//4.what is “with” statement? How do you use in files?
with statement gives better service for exeption handling
 with open("file.txt") as file:
	file.read()
file object automatically closed after operation
it will not bother about return , break, continue statment

//5.what is  the difference between “with open” and “open” in files?
	"with open" gives better exeption handling for created object
even exception accours then also file object automatically closed
	but in "open" we have to close file manually
